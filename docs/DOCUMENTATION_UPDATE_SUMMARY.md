## Director Refactoring - Flexible Triggers (v4.0)
**Date**: October 29, 2025

### Major Improvements:
**Flexible Visual Trigger System** replacing single person detection with multi-trigger support

#### Key Changes:
1. **Configuration Restructuring**:
   - Semantic naming with better organization
   - `person_detection` â†’ `visual_trigger_detection`
   - Hierarchical config with `camera`, `scene_analysis`, and `response_generation` sections
   - Cleaner separation of concerns

2. **Multiple Trigger Types** (6 available):
   - **Person Detection**: Human presence detection
   - **Vehicle Detection**: Cars, trucks, motorcycles, bicycles
   - **Animal Detection**: Pets and wildlife
   - **Motion Detection**: Significant movement
   - **Package Detection**: Deliveries and parcels
   - **Anomaly Detection**: Unusual or concerning situations

3. **Trigger Configuration**:
   - Custom prompts for each trigger type
   - Positive keyword matching for flexible detection
   - Individual enable/disable for each trigger
   - Active trigger selection system

4. **HiveMind API Alignment**:
   - Removed unsupported parameters (frequency_penalty, presence_penalty, etc.)
   - Streamlined to use only documented HiveMind API features
   - Cleaner request/response handling

5. **Voice and Audio Features** (Config prepared):
   - ASR configuration for speech recognition
   - TTS configuration with 8 voice profiles
   - Voice-specific settings (nibbles, default, billie, claptrap, cortana, gaige, moxxi, vega)

6. **Session Enhancements**:
   - Sessions now track trigger type
   - Metadata includes which trigger activated
   - Analysis and response generation per session

#### Configuration Example:
```json
{
  "visual_trigger_detection": {
    "active_trigger": "person_detection",
    "triggers": {
      "person_detection": {
        "enabled": true,
        "prompt": "Is there a person?",
        "positive_keywords": ["true", "yes", "person"]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Documentation Updates:
- **API.md**: Updated with flexible trigger system and new config structure
- **README.md**: Revised director description with trigger types
- **QUICKSTART.md**: New configuration examples with triggers
- **DOCUMENTATION_UPDATE_SUMMARY.md**: Added v4.0 changelog
